# FGD BLE Interface

This project is a **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface** built using **React**. The primary goal is to connect to BLE-enabled devices, read data , and dynamically display it in an interactive and user-friendly web interface.

---

## üìã **Project Overview**

The application will provides the following functionalities:

- **Device Connection:** Connect to BLE devices using a filtered list or specific device prefix.
- **Real-Time Data:** Read data such as battery levels or other characteristics from connected devices.
- **Dynamic Interface:** Use tabs to organize and display information interactively.
- **BLE Controls:** Easily connect, read, and disconnect from devices through the interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Features Implemented**

### 1. **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Service**

- Establishes connection with BLE devices using the Web Bluetooth API.
- Reads specific characteristics like battery levels.
- Allows seamless connection and disconnection through dynamic states.

### 2. **Dynamic Tabs Component**

- Interactive tab-based navigation to switch between multiple content sections.
- Tabs are generated dynamically using a single reusable structure.
- Highlights the active tab for better user experience.

### 3. **Responsive Navbar**

- Includes a Bluetooth icon to handle BLE connections.
- Displays battery levels retrieved from connected devices.

### 4. **Reusable Logo Component**

- Features a parallax tilt effect for a modern and engaging design.
- Used as part of the application‚Äôs visual identity.
